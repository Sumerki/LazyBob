  <h1>Steps on How To Be Lazy.</h1>

  <p><strong>Step 1. Choose the easier way:</strong> We all know chores have to be done, no matter how lazy you are they still have to get done, so if you have to do them why not make them easier to do.
  	 When doing the dishes, grab a chair or stool and set it up in front of the sink. Bam! Now you don't have to stand!</p>
  	 
  <p><strong>Step 2. Choose the easier way (part 2):</strong> When cleaning the bathroom, try to get as much work done from sitting on the toilet, if your bathroom is somewhat small, you can probably get 3/4 of the work done sitting down! Bam! Still don't have to stand.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 3. "The Zone":</strong> When your family tells you to do your homework tell them you want to be left alone so you can "get in the zone of working" but it turns out that zone is just you sitting watching TV, Playing video games, playing on your phone or just reading a book if thats your style.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Step 4. Be Lazy While Being Lazy:</strong> When watching TV keep all the remotes around you, and also a long stick or a rod, which can be used to turn off/on the lights, move things, and other things.</p>
